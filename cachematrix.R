# Caching the Inverse of a Matrix:
# Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some 
# benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly.
# Below are a pair of functions that are used to create a special object that 
# stores a matrix and caches its inverse.

# This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
              inv <- NULL
              set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                inv <<- NULL
              }
              get <- function() x
              setinverse <- function(solve) inv <<- solve
              getinverse <- function() inv
              list(set = set, get = get,
                   setinverse = setinverse,
                   getinverse = getinverse)
  
  
}


# This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" created by 
# makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the 
# matrix has not changed), then it should retrieve the inverse from the cache.


cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        inv <- x$getinverse()
        if(!is.null(inv)) {
          message("getting cached data")
